'''
Method overriding - redefine a method that was already defined in the parent (base class), using the same method name and parameters, but with new behavior
- often used to customize or extend behavior in subclasses â€” without rewriting the entire parent class.
-Method names must be the same.
-The number and type of parameters should match.
-Only works inside class inheritance.

class Employee:

class Manager(Employee):
    def get_role(self):  # Overriding the parent method

# Test
emp = Employee()
